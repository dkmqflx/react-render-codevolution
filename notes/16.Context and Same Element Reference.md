- in this video let's look at another way to optimize the context rendering behavior in react
- now this again is a technique we have already seen when trying to optimize parent child rendering
- and that is the same element reference technique

```jsx
// App.js

import './App.css';
import { ChildA } from './components/Context/ContextChildren';
import { ContextParent } from './components/Context/ContextParent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ContextParent>
        <ChildA></ChildA>
      </ContextParent>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// ContextParent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const CountContext = React.createContext();
const CountProvider = CountContext.Provider;

export const ContextParent = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('ContextParent Render');
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count {count}</button>
      <CountProvider value={count}>{children}</CountProvider>
    </>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ContextChildren.js

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { CountContext } from './ContextParent';

export const ChildA = () => {
  console.log('Child A Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child A</div>
      <ChildB />
    </>
  );
};

export const MemoizedChildA = React.memo(ChildA);

export const ChildB = () => {
  console.log('Child B Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child B</div>
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
};

export const ChildC = () => {
  const count = useContext(CountContext);
  console.log('Child C Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child C - Count = {count}</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

- i'm going to destructure children from the component props and specify the same as children to the context provider
- so within the count provider children is going to be the children props back in app.js
- we have to slightly modify the context parent invocation instead of the self-closing tag we now have opening and closing tags and as children to this component we're going to specify the child a component
- on page load we have the log messages from all the four components corresponding to the initial render
- if i clear the console and click on the count button you can see that only the parent and the child C components re-render
- the rendering behavior is optimized to the way we want it to behave
- the count value is also reflected properly in Parent and child C components

- let's quickly understand what is happening here when the setup function is called in the Parent component react cues a re-render of the component
- however react knows that rendor is caused by a state change the component also cannot modify its own props
- which means the children props could not have been modified
- what is the children prop it's the child A component
- so react now knows that child A hasn't been modified and there is no need to re-render that component
  - react render가 state의 변화로 일어난 것을 알고 있고, 컴포넌트는 props로 전달된 값을 변경하지 못한다.
  - 따라서 children props는 변경될 수 없기 때문에 child A 컴포넌트는 변경되지 않는다.
- this is an optimization react automatically takes care of as react goes down the component tree
- it will we render just the child C component as it consumes a context value whose value has been changed
- so if you're using context in your react application either make sure to wrap the immediate child of the context provider with React.memo or make sure to use the children props to make use of the same element reference optimization that react provides
