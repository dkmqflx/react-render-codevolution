### Unnecessary Renders

- When a parent component renders react will recursively render all of its child components and that is sort of the default behavior
- I mentioned that rendering is not a bad thing as it is how react knows whether it needs to actually make any changes to the dom
- “Unnecessary renders” where child component goes through the render phase but not the commit phase

---

### First case for Parent and Child component

```jsx
// App.js
import './App.css';
import { ParentOne } from './components/Optimization/ParentOne';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ParentOne></ParentOne>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// ParentOne.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildOne } from './ChildOne';

export const ParentOne = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('ParentOne Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <ChildOne />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildeOne.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildOne = () => {
  console.log('ChildOne Render');
  return <div>ChildOne component</div>;
};
```

- button을 클릭하면 'ParentOne Render'와 'ChildOne Render'가 출력된다
- 즉, child 컴포넌트가 render phase로 가지만 commit phase로 가지는 않는다
- click on the button and change state the parent component re-renders
- however the child component also re-renders the child component goes through the render phase but the render output is ignored since nothing has changed from the previous render
- the child component did not make it to the commit phase
- so at the moment we have an unnecessary render

---

### Second case for Parent and Child component

```jsx
// App.js

import './App.css';
import { ParentOne } from './components/Optimization/ParentOne';
import { ChildOne } from './components/Optimization/ChildOne';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ParentOne>
        <ChildOne></ChildOne>
      </ParentOne>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// ParentOne.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const ParentOne = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('ParentOne Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildeOne.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildOne = () => {
  console.log('ChildOne Render');
  return <div>ChildOne component</div>;
};
```

- If i click on the count, button you can see that only the ParentOne component renders
- we have optimized our code to render only the ParentOne component and not the ChildOne component when there is a state change in the parent component
- Of course at this point the child one component is more of a prop than a nested component

---

### Causes for re-render

1. A component to re-render a component can we render if it calls a set a function or a dispatch function
2. a component can also re-render if its parent component rendered

- In our first scenario where we had the child component directly nested in the parent components jsx
  - 즉, 첫번째 케이스에는 parent 컴포넌트에서 childe 컴포넌트를 import 해서 선언해주었다
- the child component we rendered when the parent component be rendered
- this is the default behavior in react

- to optimize this unnecessary render of the child component we moved the child component from being invoked in the parent components jsx to being passed as a prop
- it could be any prop but we chose to use children
  - 두번째 케이스에서는 child component를 children이라는 Props로 전달해주었다

---

### Same Element Reference

- In our component tree when we call the set a function in the parent component, the component gets flagged for a re-render
- React sees that the children prop is part of the jsx, but this children prop references the child one component
- now we all know the fundamentals in react
- a component can change its state but it can never change its props
- taking this into consideration react will automatically provide us with the optimization
- you can picture react going about the re-render in the following way

  - react looks at optimized parent one component
  - react says that it has to convert the button and the children prop to a react element
  - now react tells itself, hey this re-render is caused by a state change in the optimized ParentOne component
  - since this component has no means of directly changing the props it is receiving
  - i'm sure the children props could not have changed
  - so instead of going through the render phase for the child one component
  - i'll simply make use of the react element that was previously created
  - and that is how react assuring that the children props has to be referencing the same element from the previous render will skip the render phase for the ChildOne component

- now if at all the component was re-rendering because of a props change, then the ChildOne component would also have to be re-rendered

```jsx
// App.js

import './App.css';
import { GrandParent } from './components/Optimization/GrandParent';
import { ParentOne } from './components/Optimization/ParentOne';
import { ChildOne } from './components/Optimization/ChildOne';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <GrandParent></GrandParent>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// GrandParent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildOne } from './ChildOne';
import { ParentOne } from './ParentOne';

export const GrandParent = () => {
  const [newCount, setNewCount] = useState(0);
  console.log('GrandParent');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setNewCount((nc) => nc + 1)}>GrandParent Count - {newCount}</button>

      <ParentOne>
        <ChildOne />
      </ParentOne>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildeOne.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildOne = () => {
  console.log('ChildOne Render');
  return <div>ChildOne component</div>;
};
```

- GrandParent Count 버튼을 누르면 세 컴포넌트 에서 모두 콘솔이 출력된다
- 그 이유는 GrandParent에서 state가 바뀌면 UI가 다시 렌더링 되는데, 이 때, Parent와 Childe 컴포넌트가 모두 그 안에 있기 때문이다
- 하지만 Parent Count를 클릭하면 Parent 의 콘솔만 출력되는 것을 확인할 수 있다

- 그리고 GrandParent.js가 아래처럼 Parent 컴포넌트에 props를 전달해도 같은 상황이 발생한다

```jsx
// GrandParent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildOne } from './ChildOne';
import { ParentOne } from './ParentOne';

export const GrandParent = () => {
  const [newCount, setNewCount] = useState(0);
  console.log('GrandParent');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setNewCount((nc) => nc + 1)}>GrandParent Count - {newCount}</button>

      <ParentOne newCount={newCount}>
        <ChildOne />
      </ParentOne>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- if i click on count only ParentOne gets re-rendered
- however if i clear the console and, if i now click on the grand parent count button
- you can see that both the parent one and the child one components are re-rendered
- so what happens in this scenario is that grandparent changes its state and causes a re-render
- this in turn will cause the parent one component to re-render
- react now knows that parent one component is not re-rendering because of its own state change, but rather because of the parent component re-rendering
- that means the props could have changed so react will proceed with the render phase for the child one component
  - 즉, grand parent 컴포넌트의 state가 변경이 되면, parent 컴포넌트도 리 렌더링 된다
  - 리액트는 parent 컴포넌트의 state 변경 때문에 리렌더링 되지 않는 것을 알지만, 현재 children 이라는 props가 전달되고 있는 상황에서, grand parent에서 parent 컴포넌트로 props로 전달되는 값이 변경되었을 수도 있었기 때문에, child component도 render phas로 가게 된다.
  - 따라서 세 컴포넌트에서 모두 콘솔이 출력되는 것이다.
- but of course ignores the render output and not committed to the dom
- i know this was a pretty elaborate explanation but it is one of the lesser known optimization techniques that i wanted to bring to your attention with that example

- in react when apparent component renders react will recursively render all of its child components
- however this can lead to “unnecessary renders” where the child component goes to their interface but not the commit phase
- so if you're experiencing performance issues you can extract the expensive child component and instead pass it down as props to the parent component
- in doing so whenever there is a rerender caused by a change in the state of the parent component, react will automatically optimize the rerender for you by knowing that the props has to be referencing the same element before and after the render
- this will also prevent you from having to wrap your components with react memo everywhere in your project
- speaking of memo let's take a look at that in the next video thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe i'll see you guys in the next one
