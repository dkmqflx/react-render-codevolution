### useReducer

- when we click on a button in the user reducer component the reducer hooks dispatch function is called which flags the use reducer component as needing an update
- during the render phase react will first go through the component tree and identify the flagged components
- it sees that use reducer is the only component that needs an update
- react then uses the create element method to convert the component's jsx into a react element
- then it will diff the element produced from the previous render to the new render it will identify the changes and hand it over to the commit phase where the changes are applied to the dom
- this is what happens when you use the reducer hook in a react component now just like you state use reducer also has the exception
- if you're updating the state to the same value after the initial render, the component will not re-render if you're updating to the same value after re-renders
- react will render that specific component one more time and then bails out from any subsequent renders
- so if i reload the page the component has finished its initial render the state value is zero if i now click on the reset button which again sets the state value to zero react will not re-render the component

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = 0;
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action) {
    case 'increment':
      return state;
    case 'decrement':
      return state;
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export const UseReducer = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  console.log('UseReducer Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count = {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('increment')}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('decrement')}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('reset')}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

### useReducer and same state

- when we click on the button in the user reducer component the dispatch function is called which flags the use reducer component as needing an update
- react will go through the component tree and identify the flagged components
- it sees that use reducer component is flagged however there is a catch
- react requires that use reducer updates must pass in or return a new reference as the state value if the state is a primitive type
- it has to be a new string or number or boolean
- if it is not the case react will simply bail out from the render phase for that component
- the bailing out part though has two cases
  - if only the initial render is completed and the value passed into the dispatch function is the same as before the render phase bails out from proceeding further
  - however if the component has been re-rendered already then the component will proceed with the render phase one more time react generates the react element from the jsx reconciliation takes place react says that there is no change from the previous render and simply exits the render phase
- so that is the rendering behavior with respect to the useReducer hook

### useReducer and Render

- the dispatch function from a use reducer hook will cause the component to re-render
- however the exception is when you update the state to the same value as the current value
- if you're updating to the same value after the initial render the component will not re-render
- if you're updating to the same value after vendors react will render that specific component
- one more time and then fails out from any subsequent renders
