### Ways to cause a re-render

- so far i've mentioned two ways to cause a re-render
- in a react app, a component can re-render if it calls the use state set a function or the use reducer dispatch function
- the component can also re-render if its parent component re-renders
- now let's take a look at the context api which is another way to cause a component to re-render

- in this video we are going to understand the rendering behavior in react with respect to the context api
- first let's try to understand at a high level the render phase when we have react context in a component tree
- since we have been through this several times i'm only going to focus on what is necessary from the context point of view
- now let's assume that our application has five components app component
  - App
    - Parent - count state / CountContext.Provider
      - Child A
      - Child B
      - Child C - count
- parent component and three child components
- namely child A child B and child C
- the parent component contains A count state which it renders in the jsx and the same count value has to be rendered by child C component as well
- so we create a new CountContext in the parent component and Provide the count value
- we then use the use context hook in component C to consume that value
- pretty straightforward usage of the context api
- but let's quickly understand how the render phase works in this scenario

## Context (Re-render)

- Commit Phase

### Render Phase

- let's say the initial render is completed so all the components have been rendered once
- now since the count value is a state variable in the parent component
- let's say we called the setcountsetter function to increment the count value
- if the count value increments the component will be flagged for re-render
- we know that react starts from the root component and finds the components flagged for re-render
- react says that the Parent component has been flagged
- when it's rendering the Parent component, react says that the parent component also renders a Context Provider
- it then checks to see if the Context Provider has been given a new value
- since we increment the count value the Context Provider indeed has been given a new value
- react will make a note to re-render all the components that consume the context value
- in our example the component is child C so react makes its way down the component tree and when it encounters child C
- it is going to re-render that component and by now you probably know what happens in the rest of the render and commit phase
  - 이후 JSX를 React Elements(JavaScript objects)로 변환하고
  - Previous Render와 New render에 대해서 react elemnts를 비교한 이후, 변경된 것들을 Commit Phase에서 DOM에 반영한다.
- so this is the rendering behavior with respect to the context api

- of course there will always be certain points that we have to make note of and the context api is no exception
- let's take a look at an example and see what i'm referring to

```jsx
// CountContext.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildA, MemoizedChildA } from './ContextChildren';

export const CountContext = React.createContext();
const CountProvider = CountContext.Provider;

export const ContextParent = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('ContextParent Render');
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count {count}</button>
      <CountProvider value={count}>
        <ChildA></ChildA>
      </CountProvider>
    </>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ContextChildren.js

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { CountContext } from './ContextParent';

export const ChildA = () => {
  console.log('Child A Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child A</div>
      <ChildB />
    </>
  );
};

export const ChildB = () => {
  console.log('Child B Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child B</div>
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
};

export const ChildC = () => {
  const count = useContext(CountContext);
  console.log('Child C Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child C - Count = {count}</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

- on page load we see the render messages from the parent component and the three children components so the initial render works fine
- we can also see that the count context value from the Parent component is being consumed in the child C component
- now let's observe the render behavior when we update the count value thereby changing the context value
- if you recollect from the render phase slide,
- i mentioned that if the context provider receives a new value components consuming the context value will also get updated
- so in our case when i click on the count button in the parent, we should see that the parent and child C components should re-render
- however if i clear the console and click on the count button you can see that all the four components we render
- this includes the two children components which have nothing to do with the context value now
- this might seem confusing but the reason is pretty simple
- remember when a parent component re-renders all the children components recursively we render

  - count 버튼 클릭하면 모든 컴포넌트에서 콘솔이 출력된다
  - 그 이유는, 부모 컴포넌트가 다시 렌더링 되면 모든 자식 컴포넌트 또한 다시 렌더링 되기 때문이다.

- so what is happening in our example is that when the state in the parent component changes the parent component re-renders
- if parent re-renders every single child component also re-renders
- this is the default behavior in react

- in fact the component child C we renders because the parent we rendered and not necessarily because the context value was updated
  - 즉, count 버튼을 클릭 했을 때 컴포넌트 C가 렌더링 된 것은 된 것은 부모 컴포넌트가 다시 렌더링 되었기 때문에 다시 렌더링 된 것이지, context value가 업데이트 되었기 때문이 아니다
- you might ask yourself then what is the whole point of context
- well remember context helps you solve the problem of props drilling
- so you don't have to specify props through each nested component
- in that aspect context still remains very helpful
- but when it comes to context and the rendering behavior
- it is not the most efficient

- now i say that given we write the code like how i have written for this example
- there are a few ways to optimize the rendering behavior with context which we will see in the next few videos
- for now please keep in mind that if you write your code the way i have written
- context doesn't really have the best rendering performance
  - context api의 장점은 props drillng 문제를 해결할 수 있다는 것인데, 위 예제처럼 코드를 작성하면 rendering 부분에서는 효율적이지 않게 된다
