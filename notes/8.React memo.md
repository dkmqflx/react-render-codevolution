- another technique to optimize the rendering behavior when dealing with parent and child components and that technique is using react memo
- we'll see what it does in a minute but first let's set up the components for this example
- in the optimization folder i'm going to

```jsx
// App.js

import './App.css';
import { ParentTwo } from './components/Optimization/ParentTwo';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ParentTwo></ParentTwo>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// ParentTwo.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildTwo } from './ChildTwo';

export const ParentTwo = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Vishwas');

  console.log('ParentTwo Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setName('Codevolution')}>Change name</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <ChildTwo name={name} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildTwo.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildTwo = ({ name }) => {
  console.log('ChildTwo Render');
  return <div>ChildTwo component - {name}</div>;
};
```

- on page load you can see the log messages for the initial render ParentTwo render and ChildTwo render
- now i'm going to clear the console and click on the change name button this updates the state in the parent component
- the state is passed in as a prop to the child component
- both the components have to re-render and hence we see both the log messages in the console

- now before we proceed just one small detail that i want to highlight
- often we are used to saying that the child component re-rendered because of change in props like in this instance
- **but the fact is the child component re-rendered because the parent component re-rendered not because the props changed**
- think about it if you remove the name prop the child component still re-renders
  - 즉 ChildrenTwo의 props로 전달되는 name을 삭제해도, 콘솔이 두번 출력된다.
- when the name state changes in the parent component react does not care whether props changed
- it will always render child components just because the parent rendered
- nothing to worry much about but it was just something that i wanted to highlight

- now back to our parent and child
- so we have just seen that both the components re-rendered and it makes perfect sense because the child component has to update the ui based on the new props received

  - 부모 컴포넌트에서 props로 전달되는 state가 변했기 때문에 다시 렌더링 된다.

- now let's take a look at the first button which increments the count value
- i'm going to click the button and again we see both the log statements the parent re-rendered and so did the child
- this time however it is evident that we have an unnecessary render the count state variable does not affect the child component in any way
- so if we change the count state react should not re-render the child component
- by that i mean react shouldn't have to go through their render phase and then discard the render output
- as we have learned unnecessary renders do affect performance
- to optimize this rendering behavior we can let react know that it should re-render the child component only if its props change
- and the way to do it is using `react.memo`

- `react.memo`is a higher order component which you can use to wrap components
- if they render the same result given the same props, doing so will give you a performance boost in some cases by minimizing the render output
- **so if your component props don't change between renders, react will skip rendering the component and reuse the last rendered result**
- in our case react will skip rendering the child component and we use the render output from the previous render
- so in the ChildTwo component all we have to do is add an additional export

```jsx
// ParentTwo.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { MemoizedChildTwo } from './ChildTwo';

export const ParentTwo = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Vishwas');

  console.log('ParentTwo Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setName('Codevolution')}>Change name</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <MemoizedChildTwo name={name} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildTwo.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildTwo = ({ name }) => {
  console.log('ChildTwo Render');
  return <div>ChildTwo component - {name}</div>;
};

export const MemoizedChildTwo = React.memo(ChildTwo);
```

- count 버튼을 누를 때 마다, parent, 컴포넌트에서만 콘솔이 출력된다
- 그 이유는 name으로 전달되는 값이 변하지 않았기 때문에
- change name 버튼을 한번 누르면, name으로 전달되는 값이 변하기 때문에 parent와 children 모두 콘솔이 출력된다
- 하지만 한번 더 누르게 되면 Parent 컴포넌트에서 출력되지만 Child 컴포넌트에서는 출력되지 않는다
- 그리고 이후에 계속 버튼을 클릭해도 Parent와 Child 컴포넌트 모두 콘솔이 출력되지 않는다.

- on page load we have the two log messages from the initial render
- clear the console click on change name and both the components render as expected
- clear the console again and now i click on the count button and you can see that only the parent component renders
- **the child component does not render because react is using the memoized result**
- **since the child component props never changed, now one point to keep in mind is that memo only does a shallow comparison of the previous and new props**
- **however you can pass in a custom comparison function as the second argument to `react.memo` to meet your requirements**

### React.memo

- in react when a parent component renders a child component might unnecessarily render
- to optimize this behavior you can use `react.memo`and pass in the child component
- `react.memo` will perform a shallow comparison of the previous and new props and we render the child component only if the props have changed
- thus providing a performance boost in some scenarios so that is about `react.memo`
