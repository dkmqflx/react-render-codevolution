### Parent Child and Render with useState

```jsx
// Parent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Child } from './Child';

export const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('Parent Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Count to 0</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(5)}>Count to 5</button>
      <Child />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// Child,js

import React from 'react';

export const Child = () => {
  console.log('Child Render');
  return <div>Child component</div>;
};
```

- 가장 처음에는 마운트 되면 `console.log('Parent Render')`, `console.log('Child Render')`이 출력된다
- In react when parent component renders, react will recursively render all of its child components
- On page load the parent component will render which in turn will cause the child component to render
- Hence we have the two log statements

---

### Parent Child and Render

1. the first case is when the new state is different from the old state
   - In the browser if i click on the first button the count value increments
   - in the console you can see there are two log statements
   - One from the parent and one from the child
   - This is because of the default behavior we understood a minute ago
   - UseState function causes the parent component to re-render and if the parent component re-renders, the child component will also re-render
   
2. The second case is when the new state is the same as the old state
   - this can be further categorized into two
   
   1. Right after the initial render
      - second button calls the set a function but sets the state to zero which means the new state is same as the old state
      - if click on count to 0, we don't see any log statements changes
      - if the old state is the same as the new state, react bails out of re-rendering the component
      - in our case, react bails out of re-rendering the parent component
      - if the parent component did not pre-render, there is no need for the child component to re-render
      - hence no log statements in the console
   2. After re-renders
      - when we call the setter function passing in the same state value right after, the component has re-rendered one or more times
      - third button calls the setup function the state to 5.
      - since the new state is different from the old state react will re-render the parent component
      - if the parent component re-renders, the child component also re-renders and we see two log messages
      - if click on the third button one more time, the setter function is called with a value of five again which means that the new state is the same as the old state
      - we've already learned in the useState video that after a re-render if the old state is the same as the new state, react will re-render that component one more time as a safety measure which means that our component will re-render one more time you can see the log message
      - parent render but we don't see the message child rendor anymore so this is an exception case
      - 즉, Count 5 버튼을 한번 더 누르면 parent, child가 콘솔창에 찍히게 되고, 한번 더 Count 5 버튼을 누르면 safety net 때문에 한번 더 렌더링 되어 parent가 출력되지만, 이 때 child 는 콘솔창에 찍히지 않게 된다.
      - when you call a set a function or a dispatch function with the same state value after the rerender
      - react will render the parent component just one more time but will not re-render the child components
      - the parent component has to be rendered one more time just to be sure if it's safe to bail out from future renders
      - 첫번째 버튼 Count - 0 을 눌러서 Count - 5가 되었을 때도, 한번 더 Count 5 버튼을 누르면 safety net 때문에 한번 더 렌더링 되어 parent가 출력되지만, 이 때 child 는 콘솔창에 찍히지 않게 된다.

- so this is the rendering behavior in react with respect to parent and child components

### Parent and Child & new State

- we start with the component tree 
- we have the App component and the parent component nested inside the parent component we have the child component 
- when we click on the button in the parent component, the state hooks set a function is called which flags the parent component as needing an update
- during the render phase react will first go through the component tree and identify the flagged components 
- it sees that parent is the only component that needs an update
- react then uses the `createElement` method to convert the components jsx into a React Element
- when doing that work react sees that the parent component has a child component
- the child component was originally not flagged as needing an update
- however because its parent component rendered, react now proceeds with the render phase for the child component
- the jsx for the child component is converted to a React Element
- once the react elements for both parent and child have been created, react will then diff the elements produced from the previous render to the new render
- react makes a note that only the parent component has changed, while the child component has no changes and ignores it
- finally the changes that correspond to the parent component are handed over to the commit phase where the changes are applied to the DOM

---

### Parent Child and Render

- Button Click

  - → Parent component re-renders
  - → Child component re-renders
  - In our example every time we click on the first button, we see that the parent component be renders and so does the child component
  - but the dom node that the child component represents is never updated

- DOM represented by Child component is never updated
  - child 컴포넌트의 새로운 리액트 엘리먼트는, 이전 렌더의 리액트 엘리먼트와 다르지 않다
  - In Commit Phase, you can see that for the child component the jsx was converted to a react element and the new element wasn’t diffed with the old element
  - since both the elements were same though, react did not have to mount anything to the dom
- So the Child component went through the render phase but not the commit phase

- “Unnecessary render”
  - this is commonly referred to as an unnecessary render
  - react went through so much work in the render phase only to ignore or discard the render output and not apply it to the dom
- if your app had 10 components and the top most component re-rendered all the other 9 children components will also re-render by default
- rendering itself is not a bad thing 
- it is how react knows whether it needs to actually make any changes to the dom
- however unnecessary renders as we call them do affect performance and we will learn more about optimization in the coming videos

- **To summrize, in react when a parent component renders, react will recursively render all of its**

child components

- New state same as old state after initial render ? 
  - Both parent and child do not re-render
  - after the first initial render, if a setup function or dispatch function is called, and the new state is the same as the old state the parent component will not re-render and hence the child component will not be rendered as well
- however if the parent component has been rendered before and if a set of function or dispatch function is called and the new state is the same as the old state the parent component will we render one more time
- but the child component never re-renders

### Parent Child and Render with useReducer

- React 18에서, 아래처럼 Parent Component를 useReducer로 변경하고 나서, Reset 버튼을 누르면 계속해서 parent가 콘솔창에 출력된다.
- 즉, useState와 달리 이전과 같은 값을 갖더라도, 한번 더 render 하고 더 이상 render 하지 않는 것이 아니라 계속해서 Render가 된다.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useReducer } from 'react';
import { Child } from './Child';

const initialState = 0;
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action) {
    case 'increment':
      return state + 1;
    case 'decrement':
      return state - 1;
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export const Parent = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  console.log('Parent Render');

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count = {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('increment')}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('decrement')}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('reset')}>Reset</button>
      <Child />
    </div>
  );
};
```
