### useMemo

- in the previous video we learned that having objects or functions as part of a component can nullify the optimization that react memo provides
- any time the parent component re-renders a new reference of the object or function is created which will cause the child component to re-render
- in this video let's see how to overcome that hurdle using the use memo and use callback hooks

- now if you're looking for an in-depth explanation of useMemo and useCallback hooks
- i would suggest you refer to my react hooks tutorial in the channel where i explain in detail about the two hooks 
- since this video is concerned with just rendering i'm only going to show how to make use of the two hooks to fix the optimization problem we currently have

```jsx
// ParentFour.js

import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { MemoizedChildFive } from './ChildFive';

export const ParentFour = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Vishwas');

  const person = {
    fname: 'Bruce',
    lname: 'Wayne',
  };

  const handleClick = () => {};

  const memoizedPerson = useMemo(() => person, []);

  console.log('ParentFour Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setName('Codevolution')}>Change name</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <MemoizedChildFive name={name} person={memoizedPerson} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildFour.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildFive = ({ name, person }) => {
  console.log('ChildFive Render');
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};

export const MemoizedChildFive = React.memo(ChildFive);
```

- first let's take a look at fixing new object references between re-renders
- so i'm talking about passing down the person object as props
- we begin by importing useMemo from react
- next in the function body we create a memoized version of the person object using the useMemo hook

- so const a memoizedPerson is equal to useMemo and useMemo accepts a creator function so as to call it as its first argument
- this function creates the person object which will be memorized
- since we already have the person object we simply return it 
- now the second argument to useMemo is the dependency list
- for this contrived example our creator function does not have any dependencies
- so we can pass in an empty array

- finally on the memoized child component instead of passing in person, we pass in memoized person as the prop
- for now clear the console and click on the count button you can see that only the parent component renders and the child component does not re-render
- we have optimized the rendering of the child component with respect to new object references between rerenders
  - useMemo를 사용해서 dependency가 바뀔 때만 새로운 값이 리턴 되도록 하는데, 빈 배열이기 때문에 새로운 값이 리턴되지 않는다
  - 따라서 memoizedPerson은 count를 클릭해서 컴포넌트가 다시 렌더링 되도 새로운 값이 반환되지 않는다
  - 따라서 props로 memoizePerson으로 전달되는 값도 이전과 참조값이 같은 객체가 전달되기 때문에 부모 컴포넌트에서만 콘솔이  자식 컴포넌트에서는 콘솔이 출력되지 않는 것이다

### useCallback

```jsx
// ParentFour.js

import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';
import { MemoizedChildFive } from './ChildFive';

export const ParentFour = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Vishwas');

  const person = {
    fname: 'Bruce',
    lname: 'Wayne',
  };

  const handleClick = () => {};

  const memoizedPerson = useMemo(() => person, []);

  const memoizedHandleClick = useCallback(handleClick, []);

  console.log('ParentFour Render');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setName('Codevolution')}>Change name</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count - {count}</button>
      <MemoizedChildFive name={name} handleClick={memoizedHandleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ChildFour.js

import React from 'react';

export const ChildFive = ({ name, handleClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildFive Render');
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};

export const MemoizedChildFive = React.memo(ChildFive);
```

- next let's take a look at fixing new function references between re-renders
- we begin by importing useCallback from react so import useCallback at the top next in the function body
- we create a memoized version of this handle click function using the useCallback hook
- so const my memoizedHandleClick is equal to useCallback and useCallback accepts handle click as its first argument and the second argument is the dependency list again for our contrived example
- there are no dependencies we can pass in an empty array
- finally on the memoized child component instead of passing in handleClick we pass in the memoizedHandleClick
- if we now head to the browser clear the console
- and click on the count button, you can see that only the parent component renders and the child component does not re-render
- we have optimized the rendering of the child component with respect to new function references between re-renders
- so that is how to make use of use memo and use callback with react memo to optimize component rendering
