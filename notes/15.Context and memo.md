### Context and Render

- in the last video we learned about the rendering behavior with respect to the context api
- we learned that when the context provider is in the parent component and the parent components state updates, every child component re-renders and not just the component consuming the context value
- in this video let's see what is a simple possible solution to improve the rendering behavior

- right now in our example when the count state updates the default rendering behavior causes all the children components to re-render
- ideally what we want is only the Parent component and the child C component to re render the way to achieve that is using react memo

```jsx
// ContextParent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { MemoizedChildA } from './ContextChildren';

export const CountContext = React.createContext();
const CountProvider = CountContext.Provider;

export const ContextParent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log('ContextParent Render');
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Count {count}</button>
      <CountProvider value={count}>
        <MemoizedChildA></MemoizedChildA>
      </CountProvider>
    </>
  );
};
```

```jsx
// ContextChildren.js

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { CountContext } from './ContextParent';

export const ChildA = () => {
  console.log('Child A Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child A</div>
      <ChildB />
    </>
  );
};

export const MemoizedChildA = React.memo(ChildA);

export const ChildB = () => {
  console.log('Child B Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child B</div>
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
};

export const ChildC = () => {
  const count = useContext(CountContext);
  console.log('Child C Render');
  return (
    <>
      <div>Child C - Count = {count}</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

- on page load we have the four log messages corresponding to the initial render
- now if i clear the console and click on the count button we see the log messages from only the Parent and child C component
  - Count 버튼을 클릭하면 Parent와 컴포넌트 A만 콘솔이 출력된다.
- the rendering behavior is optimized to the way we want it to behave
- let's quickly understand what is happening here when we click on the count button the state changes in the Parent component which causes the Parent component to re-render
- because the parent rendered react now has to re-render the child component
- for the child component is wrapped with React.memo
- so react checks if the props have changed
- since there are no props to begin with props haven't changed and react decides it doesn't have to render the child A component
- since the child A component did not render child B component has no reason to render
- so we don't see the log statements for child A and child B

  - 컴포넌트 A가 memo로 wrapping 되어 있는 상태에서 props로 전달되는 값이 없기 때문에 렌더링 되지 않는다
  - 컴포넌트 A가 렌더링 되지 않았기 때문에 컴포넌트 B도 렌더링 되지 않는다.

- now react arrives at child C it sees that it consumes the count context value whose value has now changed
- so react proceeds to re-render child c component
- so any time we increment the count value and provide a new value to the context provider
- only the component consuming that value is re-rendered
- in our case that is the child C component
  - 컴포넌트 C에 도착하면, context value를 consume하고 있는지 확인하고 해당 값이 변경되었는지 확인한다
  - 값이 변경되었기 때문에 컴포넌트 C를 다시 렌더링 해주는 것이다.
- now something you have to remember is that if the child C component has children components those children components will get re-rendered because of the default parent child rendering behavior in react

  - 만약 컴포넌트 C가 자식 컴포넌트를 가지고 있다면, 컴포넌트 C가 렌더링 되면 부모 컴포넌트가 렌더링 되면 자식 컴포넌트가 되기 때문에, 자식 컴포넌트에 해당 하는 컴포넌트가 모두 렌더링 된다.

- but this is pretty much how you can optimize the context rendering behavior with React.memo
- by wrapping the child component of the context provider with React.memo state updates in the parent component will not force every component to re-render
- but only the components where the context is consumed
