### Questions on Optimization

- when do i use the same element reference technique and when do i use react dot memo ?
  - same Element Reference
    - you can use the same element reference technique when your parent component re-renders because of state change in the parent component which results in the child component having to re-render
    - do keep in mind that this technique does not work if the parent component re-renders because of changes in its props
      - 즉 부모 컴포넌트가 state가 변해서 리렌더링 되는 것이아니라 props로 받아오는 값 때문에 리렌더링 된다면, 그 때는 child 컴포넌트도 리렌더링 된다
      - so same element reference yes, when state is causing parent to re-render and no if props is causing parent to re render
  - React.memo
    - on the other hand you can use react.memo when your child component is being asked to re-render due to changes in the parent components state which do not affect the child component props in any way.
    - now there is also an overlapping scenario, what if the child component does not have any props
    - react.memo should still work
    - in that case it is still better to go with same element reference because that is something react automatically provides for you and it also prevents you from having to add react. memo all over your code base
      - 즉, props로 아무것도 전달되지 않을 때는 same element reference를 사용하는게 더 낫다
    - hopefully these points shed some light on when to use the two optimization techniques

- if react.memo provides the optimization by comparing the props why not wrap every single component with react.memo ?
- or you can also rephrase it to ask why doesn't react just internally memoize every component and not expose react.memo to the developers ?
  - to answer this question i'm going to quote Dan abramov,
  - “shallow comparisons aren't free they are O(prop count) time complexity and they only buy something if it bails out
  - all comparisons where we end up re-rendering are wasted
  - why would you expect always comparing to be faster considering many components always get different props”

### React.memo and hypothetical time

- i can't put that in even simpler terms but let's make use of some math to understand
- what he's saying let's say a normal component takes 10 milliseconds to render - **Component render time : 10ms**
- obviously we want to optimize this if possible
- so we wrap it with react.memo now dan mentions that shallow comparison isn't free which means it doesn't happen in 0 milliseconds
- let's say the shallow comparison takes 2 milliseconds - **React.memo time : 2ms**

- now let's take a look at a few rendering scenarios
- let's say in our first round of re-render the props did not change
- so we have the shallow comparison of two milliseconds and that's it
- we don't have to render the component - F**irst re-render → no props change : 2ms**

- in the next render let's say the props changed
- so this time react first does the shallow comparison costing us 2 milliseconds
- and because the props aren't the same react renders a component which takes 10 milliseconds
- now we have taken 12 milliseconds in total to render the component - S**econd re-render - props change - 2ms + 10ms = 12ms**

### Component render history

- provided that many components most of the time always receive new props your component rendering history could be something like this
- 10 milliseconds for initial render
- 2 milliseconds for optimized render
- 12 milliseconds for re-render
- 12 milliseconds for re-render
- 12 milliseconds for re-render
- and you get the point so by wrapping everything in react.memo can actually be decrimental to the performance of your app
- therefore it is always a good idea to memorize only expensive components where the props hardly change

- another point to keep in mind is when you optimize the rendering of one component, react will also skip rendering that components entire subtree because it's effectively stopping the default
- “rendor children recursively behavior of react well”
- that it is not a good idea to wrap every component
